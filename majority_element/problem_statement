Problem Introduction
Majority rule is a decision rule that selects the alternative which has a majority, that is, more than half the votes.
Given a sequence of elements 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, you would like to check whether it contains an element that appears more than 𝑛/2 times.

Problem Description
Task. The goal in this code problem is to check whether an input sequence contains a majority element. Input Format. The first line contains an integer 𝑛, the next one contains a sequence of 𝑛 non-negative
integers 𝑎0, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛−1.
Constraints. 1≤𝑛≤105;0≤𝑎𝑖 ≤109 forall0≤𝑖<𝑛.
Output Format. Output 1 if the sequence contains an element that appears strictly more than 𝑛/2 times, and 0 otherwise.
